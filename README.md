# Rosembrok function

Here an implementation of steepest descent and conjugate gradient methods can be found, devoted to minimize the Rosembrok function (currently define with (a, b = (1, 100), but easily modifiable).

In order to execute it, 'Rosembok_function.c' may be run (compiled with 'Rosembok_function.h', where the function is defined).

The output will be stored in a new file, 'Results.dat', in which we can find each node's id, name and cumulative distance.
