# Rosembrok function

Here an implementation of steepest descent and conjugate gradient methods can be found, devoted to minimize the Rosembrok function (currently define with (a, b) = (1, 100), but easily modifiable).

In order to execute it, 'Deterministic_optimization.c' may be run once it is compiled with 'Rosembok_function.h', where the function is defined.

The output will be printed in the screen, with information about the method used, the number of steps, the minimum point found and the image of the function there. Steepest descent method, and normal and partial conjugate grandient methods with both Fletcher Reeves and Polak Ribiere methods will be executed.
